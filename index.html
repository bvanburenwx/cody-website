          <h2>Meet Cody</h2>
          <p>
            I’m a Triangle-based real estate agent who believes in being honest, prepared, and fully invested in my clients. 
            My job is to make sure you always feel one step ahead—never rushed, pressured, or left guessing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I study the market daily, pay close attention to pricing and neighborhood trends, and communicate clearly so you can 
            make decisions with confidence. Whether you’re buying or selling, I’ll walk you through your options, explain the “why” 
            behind the strategy, and keep the process as calm and straightforward as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the day, real estate is personal. You deserve someone who shows up for the details and for you.
