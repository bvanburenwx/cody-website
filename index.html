          <h2>Meet Cody</h2>
          <p>
            I’m Cody, a Compass real estate agent based in the Triangle. I work with people
            who want more than a sales pitch—they want someone who will listen, explain the
            “why” behind the strategy, and stay in their corner from the first conversation
            to the closing table.
          </p>
          <p>
            I pay close attention to pricing, neighborhood trends, and timing so you can
            make decisions that feel good in both the short term and the long run. I’m big
            on clear communication, realistic expectations, and making sure you never feel
            rushed or talked over.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the day, real estate is personal. You’re not just buying or
            selling a property—you’re setting up the next chapter of your life. I take that seriously.
