            <h2>Meet Cody</h2>
            <p>
              I’m Cody, a Compass real estate agent based in the Triangle. I
              work with people who want more than a sales pitch— they want
              someone who will listen, explain the “why” behind the strategy,
              and stay in their corner from the first conversation to the
              closing table.
            </p>
            <p>
              I pay close attention to pricing, neighborhood trends, and timing
              so you can make decisions that feel good in both the short term
              and the long run. I’m big on clear communication, realistic
              expectations, and making sure you never feel rushed or talked
              over.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of the day, real estate is personal. You’re not just
              buying or selling a property—you’re setting up the next chapter of
              your life. I take that seriously.

            <h2>Real Estate Strategy Session</h2>
            <p>
              Choosing a real estate agent is a big decision. You should feel
              comfortable, heard, and confident that the person you hire
              understands both the market and what matters most to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              I offer a free, no-pressure 15–20 minute strategy call where we
              can talk through your situation, the current Triangle market, and
              what next steps might look like—whether you’re thinking about
              buying, selling, or both.
            </p>
            <p>
              If it feels like a good fit, we’ll map out a plan together. If
              not, you’ll still walk away with more clarity than you had before.
